This document keeps track of optimizations to do once stabilized the server with all the necessary fixes.

1 Optimize the improved polymorph in Unit.cpp, line 624. Do check in RemoveAurasWithInterruptFlags, if possible.
2 Test the proper functioning of the burning embers on the test server.

10 Place the tooltip with the right value of attack power given when you hover the cursor over the stat agility or strength in Cat and Bear Form (attack power as it actually works).
11 Rehabilitating Wild Mushroom spell and fix this crash that follows when used.
12 Improving the management of the filter of the targets in stealth for scripting Multi Shot and Holy Wrath
13 Managing the case where a player and a unit (eg, dummy) overlap and are under Ring of Frost. The temporary fixes bug reduces this to occur only when a player and a non-player overlap thanks to spellInfo-> Effects [EFFECT_0].

14 In the function Player :: ResetDuelStatsAndCooldown, the SetPower not update graphically the actual power. This bug occurs POWER_RUNIC_POWER, POWER_FOCUS and POWER_RAGE (Warrior only). The bug recurs in other calls SetPower, except for those in the script, where it works correctly.
